# lab01-calculator
The Calculator class creates a Calculator object that takes two inputs 
as parameters and will implement the 'getFirstInput' and 'getSecondInput' getter 
methods. It will also implement methods such as 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', and 'power' to include 
some of the more basic calculations that a Calculator should provide to the user.
